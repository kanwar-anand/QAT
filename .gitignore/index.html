						<h2>Welcome to Q.A.T. Business Services</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Whether you need bookkeeping, payroll, tax return preparation, or training, you know you need the best. That's what Q.A.T. Business Services is here for - to provide 
						the best people available. Our typical client comes to us with horror stories of previous service providers. They quickly learn that there is a right way, and that 
						Q.A.T. always follows that path.  </p>
						<p>We are often asked what Q.A.T. stands for. It represents our basic beliefs: Quality, Accuracy, and Timeliness.</p>

						<h2>Q</h2>

					<p>Q is for Quality, a word that is trite, almost meaningless by overuse. At Q.A.T., though, it is one of our three basic beliefs. We constantly strive for excellence, 
					which we know is founded on quality. Going beyond expectations and continually looking for ways to improve are at the centre of who we are. Our clients get the very best 
					that is available.</p>

					<p>A is for Accuracy, which is the essential core of any financial information system. Every transaction, and we do mean every, must be accurately recorded. Does that put

						<h2>Q.A.T. Bookkeeping</h2>
						<p>A bookkeeping system is much more than a way to keep the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) happy. With a properly designed chart of accounts and industry-standard bookkeeping procedures, management can 
						use financial information to define growth strategies. The bookkeeping system is a key tool for growing a small business into a medium-sized business. As you know, though, you need the support of a 
						properly trained, diligent bookkeeper to make this happen.</p>

						<p>There is a difference between bookkeeping and accounting. In fact, it's quite a big difference.</p>

						<p>Bookkeepers record your transactions in a set of books, employing a number of techniques to make sure they are recorded correctly. No one knows the nitty-gritty details of individual transactions 
						better than your bookkeeper.</p>

						<p>Accountants analyze the financial information recorded in your books, applying adjustments as necessary to make the information comparable between periods and between companies. No one knows your 
						strategic direction better than your accountant.</p>

						<p>It's the old forest vs. the trees analogy. Bookkeepers work with the trees; accountants work with the forest. The bookkeeper makes sure each individual tree is healthy; the accountant makes sure 
						the forest is healthy. The importance of a good bookkeeper cannot be overstated: If the trees are sick, the forest will be sick and your accountant won't be able to do his or her job.</p>

						<p>Q.A.T. is happy to work with whatever accountant you choose and will quickly exceed his or her expectations as well as your own. For those small businesses and non-profits that choose not to have 
						an accountant, we offer complete bookkeeping and tax return preparation services, including:</p>

						<h2 style="text-align:center;">Tax Return Preparation</h2>
					</header>
					<p style="text-align:center;">Some tax returns are harder than others. How much money are businesses throwing away by missing expenses, deductions, elections, and credits? If a tax return preparer misses those things, the CRA may process 
					the return with no error messages and you will never know about the money you lost. Q.A.T. Business Services specializes in business income tax, including sole proprietorships, partnerships, corporations, charities, 
					non-profits, and trusts.</p>

					<p style="text-align:center;">Q.A.T. has been preparing tax returns since the early 1970's. We even created our own software for T1's and all the supporting forms. Every return is checked manually and by the computer to ensure nothing is missed.</p>

					<p style="text-align:center;">Our expertise puts us in an enviable position. We thrive on the challenges of difficult situations. If you're running into trouble with the CRA or are unsure of previously submitted returns, we're the ones you want to talk to.</p>

					<p style="text-align:center;">[Q.A.T. also prepares individual (non-business) tax returns. Most of these returns can be completed at our low $60 price, with steep discounts for the 2nd, 3rd, and subsequent members of a family. It's a great deal, but we are limited 
					in the number of new non-business clients we can accept. Call for more information.] </p>
